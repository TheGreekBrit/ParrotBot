# ParrotBot

Mostly just made to play around with Slack's client library. It's pretty messy, and the concept is a joke amongst my coworkers, but it works.

# Use
If someone types `!parrot` in a Slack channel then the bot will respond with a random fact about the kakapo bird. The facts are in the facts.js file.
